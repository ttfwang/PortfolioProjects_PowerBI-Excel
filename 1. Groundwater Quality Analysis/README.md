# Groundwater_Quality_Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of groundwater quality around wastewater treatment plants(WWTPs). The objective of this project is to monitor, assess, and report on the impact of wastewater treatment on surrounding groundwater resources. The analysis includes data collection, statistical analysis, and visualization of key groundwater quality parameters.

## Overview

This project focuses on monitoring and analyzing the trends in groundwater quality around WWTPs. By examining various water quality parameters, we aim to understand the potential environmental impacts and assist in developing strategies for inspection and maintenance of wet weather storage for WWTPs. 

## Data

The dataset includes groundwater quality measurements taken from various monitoring bores around multiple WWTPs. Key parameters analysed include pH, Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Ammonia, Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, COD and Bod5.

## Dashboard Key Information and Benefits
### Key Information Displayed on the Dashboard:

* **Exceedance Rate**: A number card showing the rate at which groundwater quality parameters exceed the selected guideline limits.
* **Number of Exceedances**: A number card displaying the total number of exceedances based on the selected guideline limit.
* **Number of Bores**: A number card indicating the number of monitoring bores at each site when a site is selected.
* **Exceedances by Bore**: A bar chart showing the number of exceedances for each bore.
* **Average Concentration**: A line dot chart displaying the average concentration of parameters across multiple bores over the selected period.

### Benefits of the Dashboard:
* **Trend Identification**: Easily identify trends in groundwater quality over time.
* **Key Insights**: Quickly access key information about water quality by observing the exceedance rate.
* **Site Comparison**: Compare the number of exceedances and average concentrations across different sites and bores.
* **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use the insights provided by the dashboard to make informed decisions regarding groundwater quality management and environmental impact mitigation.
